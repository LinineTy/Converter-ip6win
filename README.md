当前只是一个由python编写的脚本，你可以自行将它打包为程序  
当初写这个脚本的目的是想在Windows上通过ipv6使用smb，但是经过多次尝试始终无法建立连接，所以直接不研究了  
然后发现用来获取ip还蛮方便的，就稍微改了改改成了现在这样子，只是初版，勿喷~  
It's currently just a script written in python, and you can package it as a program yourself  
The original purpose of writing this script was to use smb over ipv6 on Windows, but after many attempts, the connection could not be established, so I will not study it directly  
Then found that used to get ip is quite convenient, slightly changed to change into this way, just the first version, do not spray ~
